One of the early activities in the Career Readiness module involved reflecting on our existing skills and interests. The goal was to connect our personal strengths and passions to potential ICT career paths.

### **Action**  
I thoughtfully filled out the worksheet, identifying skills like problem-solving, attention to detail, and communication. I also listed interests in software development, system analysis, and tech-based problem-solving. This reflection helped clarify how my abilities and passions align with ICT career roles.

### **Result**  
The activity confirmed that I'm on the right path pursuing a career in software development or system analysis.
