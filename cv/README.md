## ‚úçÔ∏è Reflection (STAR Technique)

### **Situation**  
During the Career Readiness module, I was introduced to a "Create a CV" quiz. The aim was to evaluate and improve my understanding of how to structure a professional CV suitable for job applications in the ICT industry.

### **Task**  
I was required to complete the quiz and use the feedback to reflect on CV formatting, the inclusion of key sections, and best practices for presentation and relevance.

### **Action**  
I took the quiz, answering questions about layout, content prioritization, and the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts of writing a CV. I paid close attention to the rationale behind the correct answers and took notes to improve my own CV.

### **Result**  
The quiz improved my confidence in crafting a clean, professional CV. It taught me the value of tailoring my CV for each job application, emphasizing achievements over duties, and maintaining a clear structure. I now have a strong understanding of how to present my qualifications effectively to potential employers.
